NexusLIMS-Logger
================


Logger (TKinter) GUI branched off from original NexusLIMS repository.

To run the Logger GUI, a file named ``config.json`` must be created and stored in the location::

    $HOME/nexuslims/gui/config.json

The default ``$HOME`` directory is unique for different operating systems.  A discription of
the default $HOME directories for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory>`_.
The ``config.json`` file contains information about the user that is required by the Logger GUI
to store data.  The required information is as follows::

    {
        "database_name": "nexuslims_db.sqlite",
        "database_relpath": "TEMdata/nexuslims",
        "networkdrive_hostname": "192.168.0.166",
        "networkdrive_workgroup": "",
        "networkdrive_username": "",
        "networddrive_password": "",
        "daq_relpath": "TEMdata/daq"
    }

There are two methods to run the Logger GUI; through a command line or as an executable file
