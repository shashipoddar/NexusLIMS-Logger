Session Logging
=========================

To accurately know what files should be included in each Experiment's record,
it is important to have a timestamp for the beginning `and` end of when a user
has collected data. To facilitate collecting this information, a small
application has been written that is run from the microscope support (or
control) PC and logs basic session information to the
NexusLIMS database. This document explains how this
application is used, its design, what information it collects, and how it is
deployed to the individual microscopes.

How to use the Logger GUI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the Logger GUI is very simple. The program can be run as an executable file or through a command line.  
Directions for installing and configuring the Logger GUI can be found
:doc:`here <readme>`. When the Logger GUI is started, there will be a short delay (about 5 seconds, depending on the instrument)
and a display window will appear on the user's screen, shown below.

The laptop name and date/time the Logger GUI was opened are shown in blue font, and there are four buttons at the bottom called
``Copy Data``, ``End session``, ``Add Session Note``, and ``Show Debug Log``.  Once this window is displayed,
the user should simply keep the window open while they work (minimizing the window is no problem).  The Logger
GUI does not perform any actions during this stage, and is simply waiting for the user to click the ``End session`` button.
Before the ``End session`` button is clicked, the user has the option to add notes to the active session by clicking
the ``Add Session Note`` button.

When the user has finished collecting data, they will click the ``End session`` button in the window. This will trigger
the application to label the current experiment as finished in the `database <https://euclid-techlabs-llc.github.io/NexusLIMS/database.html>`_,
and the Logger GUI will close by itself after a short delay.

What if something goes wrong?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the event that the Logger GUI encounteres an error, it will inform the user and a pop-up debugging log with 
more information will appear (this log can also be accessed by clicking the ``Show Debug Log`` button).

.. _interrupted:

Interrupted sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the Logger GUI window is manually closed during a session, another window will appear that asks the user if they would 
like to cancel closing the window, pause the session, or end the session.

    :figclass: align-center

Clicking on ``Pause Session`` will immediatly close the Logger GUI without sending any further information 
to the database.  The ``Pause Session`` button should only be clicked if the user plans to resume the session
before another user would use the same instrument (i.e. they need to restart their computer). If an instrument session
is paused but the ``End session`` button is never clicked, the next time the Logger GUI is run the user will be 
prompted to confirm whether they want to continue the existing session or start a new one.

Actions performed by the Logger GUI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The NexusLIMS Logger GUI performs a number of steps to record that an
Experiment has occurred, and keeps the progress bar up to date while it is
operating. These steps are detailed below.

.. _step-1:

1. Mounting the network share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first action performed by the Logger GUI is to "ping" the central file server
where data is saved and the NexusLIMS database is stored. This action initiates when the 
Logger Gui is opened. Based on the response, the logger stores the IP address of this server (to avoid problems
with the DNS server). The Logger GUI then looks at the currently mounted drives on
the microscope computer and picks a drive letter that is not in use. With this
information, the program runs a Windows command to mount the drive. When this
action is completed, the Logger GUI confirms that the database file can be accessed,
and raises an error if not.  

2. Getting the instrument name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the database file on the mounted drive, the Logger GUI queries
the ``instruments`` table in the database using the `"hostname"` of the current
computer. In this way, a computer name gets mapped to an instrument persistent 
identifier (PID) and this value is stored for later use. Directions for finding
your computers `"hostname"` can be found `here <https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/computer-names/>`_.

If the `"hostname"` of the user's computer does not match any computer names 
specified in the `database <https://euclid-techlabs-llc.github.io/NexusLIMS/database.html>`_,
the Logger GUI will be unable to map the computer name to an instrument persistent identifier (PID)
and an error message will appear.

3. Checking instrument status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before logging the start of a new Experiment, first the Logger GUI
checks to ensure that the most recent entry logged for this instrument was
an ``'END'`` entry, meaning that the last session was marked as finished.
For example, the code runs a query such as the following to get the most
recent entry (that was not a record generation event):

..  code-block:: sql

    SELECT event_type, session_identifier, id_session_log, timestamp
    FROM session_log WHERE instrument = 'Instrument ABC'
    AND NOT event_type = 'RECORD_GENERATION'
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;

If this most recent entry is an ``'END'``, the database is in its expected
normal state, and the application continues on as normal. If it is instead a
``'START'`` entry, then the application asks the user
whether they want to continue the existing session found in the database, or
start a new one (see the `interrupted session <interrupted_>`_ section for more
details). If the user chooses to continue the existing session, the Logger
GUI notes the session identifier from the database for that session and
jumps to `step 6 <step-6_>`_.

.. _step-4:

4. Inserting a ``START`` log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the instrument PID known and a randomly generated identifier string, the
Logger GUI runs a database insertion query on the ``session_log`` table to record
that a session has been started. While not explicitly specified in the query,
the current timestamp is also included in the insertion. As an example:

..  code-block:: sql

    INSERT INTO session_log (instrument, event_type,
                             session_identifier, user)
    VALUES ('Instrument ABC', 'START',
            'c9b774c9-4a59-4154-af05-0e2477e57cc4', 'local_user');

After this has finished, the Logger GUI runs another query to verify that the row
was inserted into the database as expected, and raises an error if not.

5. Unmounting the network share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the session start log has been added, the network share created in step 1
is unmounted to clean up while the Logger GUI waits for the next
action. While the application is waiting, it simply sits idle until the
`"End session"` button is pressed.

.. _step-6:

6. Ending the session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the user clicks the `"End session"` button, the Logger GUI again
mounts the network share (as in `step 1 <step-1_>`_) so it can communicate with
the NexusLIMS database. Using the same `session identifier`
value as before, the application inserts a corresponding ``'END'`` log into the
database using a query very similar to that in `step 4 <step-4_>`_.
After verifying that this record was inserted correctly, the application
then updates the status of both the ``'START'`` and ``'END'`` logs for this
session from ``'WAITING_FOR_END'`` to ``'TO_BE_BUILT'``. This status indicates
to the `record builder <https://euclid-techlabs-llc.github.io/NexusLIMS/record_building.html>`_, that it should go ahead to
actually build and upload the record for this Experiment.

7. Cleaning up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After updating the logs in the previous step, the Logger GUI unmounts
the network share (as before), and if everything went according to plan,
waits three seconds and then shuts itself down. At this point, it is ready
to be run again by the next user that arrives to begin a new session.

Information collected
+++++++++++++++++++++

As described above and in the `database <https://euclid-techlabs-llc.github.io/NexusLIMS/database.html>`_, the
Logger GUI collects the bare minimum amount of information required
to compile an Experiment's record. The values collected from the microscope
computer that are recorded to the database with each log are:

+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|        Variable        |                   Description                    |
+========================+==================================================+
| ``session_identifier`` | A random UUID4 (36-character string) that        |
|                        | is consistent among the record's                 |
|                        | record's ``"START"``, ``"END"``, and             |
|                        | ``"RECORD_GENERATION"`` events.                  |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``instrument``         | The instrument PID associated with               |
|                        | this microscope's computer                       |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``timestamp``          | The current date and time (in local time)        |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``event_type``         | The type of log for this session (either         |
|                        | ``"START"`` for the beginning of an Experiment,  |
|                        | or ``"END"`` for the end of one).                |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``record_status``      | The status of the record                         |
|                        | associated with this session.                    |
|                        | Its value is ``"WAITING_FOR_END"`` at first, but |
|                        | is updated to ``"TO_BE_BUILT"`` after the        |
|                        | session has ended.                               |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``user``               | The username of the currently logged in user     |
|                        | (often this is just ``supervisor`` or ``admin``) |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
